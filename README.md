1. The "charge_fitting_error.csv" file record the mostly errors of "charge_fitting" jobs
2. The "conformation_error.csv" file record the mostly errors of "conformation_frag" jobs
3. The "intra_fitting_error.csv" file record the mostly errors of "intra_fitting" jobs
4. The "frag_error.csv" file record the mostly errors of "frag" jobs
5. The "other_error.csv" file record all errors that the keywords are not in 'error_type'

note: Sometimes the script cannot grab all error information, you still need to see the error in 'dag' page.
      Before you run the script, you'd better check the 'path'.
